# MMIV Project

This repository contains the project code for MMIV (2004), a faux-imageboard platform made from the ground-up in Golang.

## About

The main objective of this project is to create a simple, rather basic imageboard-like platform that can be hosted with
relative ease on a platform that supports Golang.
